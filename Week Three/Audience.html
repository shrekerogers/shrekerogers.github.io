             <h2>Spud Country Audience</h2>
             <p>With any topic there is countless results when looking for an answer.  While researching this the topic of weather
                I came across the following article "Five Best Weather Web Sites, Life Hacker, by Alan Henry 22 Feb. 2015" and it lists 
                five of the top websites to get infromation about the Weather.

                The first that is mentioned is NOAA "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."(http://www.weather.gov/)  This is 
                a U.S. Goverenment run website that multiple groups including other weather websites use to get the latest in weather.
                This means there audience tackles all tracks of life or attempts to cover all audiences.  This includes the individual,
                private business, government, aviation, and any audience you can think of is the audience that NOAA speaks/caters to.
                A part of this is the fact that they have acess to all sources of gathering weather information and as such are viewed
                as the experts.  They offer weather for a local area, regions, and national forcasts.  They are viewed and widely considered
                at least here in the U.S. as the experts.
                <b></b>

                The second website I looked at and referenced from this article in the "Weather Underground."(https://www.wunderground.com/)
                This website like others relies on the same data that NOAA uses.  It is aimed at similar people to NOAA but caters to the more 
                of the do it your self kind of person.  Everything in the websites is custamizable.  It includes the ability to create you own 
                weather forecast models.

                In conclusion, NOAA caters to all and as such provides the latest in weather data with some level of custamizable menus
                to make the data be in a better layout for the visitor to the website.  Weather Underground provides the same info that 
                NOAA does but offers a user set up that is completly custamizable and even allows the user to create their own forcast.
                To have access to the most recent data Weather Underground does require a small fee.  So it is more aimed the techy and 
                do it your self audience then NOAA.
