                describe the target audience being judicious about the selection of the most plausible demographics.
                Some visitor demographic information to consider is age, income, education, experience with the topic and family status.

                What device will they be using?
                
                Be sure to include scenarios that describe the visitors purpose in visiting and using the site of which the site 
                content can provide the answers such as
                
                Does that store carry a polo shirt in my size? What color options exist? Price?
                How do I make a CSS-driven drop-down navigation bar?
                I need to transfer funds from one account to another at my bank.
                Who won the game last night? What was the score?
                What's the weather going to be this weekend at the trail I'm planning to hike?
