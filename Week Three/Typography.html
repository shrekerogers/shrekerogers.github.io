                <h2>Spud Country Typography</h2>
                <p>The concept of Typograpgy is the use of fonts in reference to be used and applied.  The fonts to be used
                    are Work Sans Serif for the main content/body and Oswald for the headers and footers to add them being bold.
                
                </p>
                <!--<p>The typography section of the planning document provides examples of the fonts to be used and where they are to be applied.
                    You may wish to combine this section with the color scheme section as your provide application references in your plan. 
                    Be careful in your selection and use of typography as this critical design element is often overlooked and not tested in all views. 
                    Proper application of typography requires design and technical skills. You want to draw in the appropriate level of 
                    attention with your usable typography but no overwhelm, distract, nor confuse the user. The ultimate goal of 
                    typography, regardless of subjective opinions, is to properly communicate. 
                    This means you sometimes have to heed the prevailing wind of opinion which will still be safe in presenting readable text that 
                    presents a mood. In web design you can work with not only the font family, 
                    but also the size, line height and text measure or width.
                </p>-->
